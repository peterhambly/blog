Welcome to my blog. I will mainly be blogging about boring technical things related to my work on the [RIF](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility). The The Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) is a freely-available software application that supports two types of environmental health activities and I have been leading a *small* team working on it more some years now. It is nearly done which is a good time to share some of the lessons and experiences. We made some mistakes along the way, learnt a lot and have built a fantastic piece of software

I will probably include a bit of caving as well, just to prove I am not just a nerd but a crazy one two.

A big thanks to Barry Clark the creator of [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for allowing me to create this blog easily
