title: Welcome to my blog!

Welcome to my blog. I will mainly be blogging about boring technical things related to my work on the [RIF](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility). The Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) is a freely-available Epidemiology application that supports two types of environmental health activities and I have been leading a *small* team working on it more some years now. It is nearly done which is a good time to share some of the lessons and experiences. We made some mistakes along the way, learnt a lot and have built a fantastic piece of software.

Coming up:

* Using apps to safely run epidemiology studies in the cloud. Large scale epidemiology studies [Aircraft noise and cardiovascular disease near Heathrow airport in London: small area study](https://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5432) uses millions of health records. Surely not!
* Why Angular changed my life. I am not a web developer. I learnt my skills in a world where the coolest thing was to be a Unix kernel developer. BSD of course. But I need to work with the Web...
* Will we ever stop using old technology to do Big data? Or perhaps when will we use Big Data Technology as it was intended?

I will probably include a bit of caving as well, just to prove I am not just a nerd but a crazy one two.

A big thanks to Barry Clark the creator of [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for allowing me to create this blog easily.
